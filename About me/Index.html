    <h2>My name is Seth Vanderhoven</h2>
    <p>I am from Menlo Park, California. I am currently studying computer science and with this I would like to go into cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>love to read, go to the beach, ballroom dance, color, and watch tv. Ballroom dancing is something that I take classes here on campus. I am not married, unfortunatly.</p>
    <p>BYU-I is great for meeting people. There are so many events that if you wanted to you could go to many different activites everyday. I hope that I can get a better grasp on web design. I am pretty new to coding and I believe that this class will help me become familiar with coding. I have been a memeber of the church my entire life. I don't really have a favorite quote from the leaders of the church.</p>
